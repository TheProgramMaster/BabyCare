## Brief Description

The project our team has chosen to complete for this course
 is a Baby Care mobile application.

This mobile application is to be used by pregnant women and new
mothers who may need guidance in either managing their pregnancy
or balancing the responsibilities and stress of being a new mother.

Our application is to act in assisting in the communication between
mothers/pregnant women and doctors throughout the guidance process.
Additionally, our mobile application may be used, not only to select
from one of applicable doctors for quality care from the mother's
client-side, but also may be used for mothers to select from one
of many quality babysitters as well. We will also include an AI
chatbot for patient use in our project.
